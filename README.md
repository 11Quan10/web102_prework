## Notes

The template of this project was really well-made. The only issue that confused me was a task item in Challenge 2 asking to "Examine `index.css`" but the step item above it says to "Check out `style.css`", and there are no indeed no files named `index.css`. Other than that the project gave useful resources as quick refreshers for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which I really appreciate.
